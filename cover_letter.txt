To,
The Hiring Manager,
Intern hiring committee,

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to you today to apply for an intern position at your company. I am currently working as a research assistant in the domain of Semantic Web with Dr. Anupam Joshi at UMBC’s Ebiquity Research Group, while I pursue my Master’s in Data Science degree at UMBC. Previously, I was employed as a Software Developer for seven years with Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) in India. While on that job I acted as a team lead and obtained several professional certifications in Oracle Applications. Essentially, I am an expert software developer with the ability to perform research work when needed.

I possess the motivation to improve my skills by working on advanced degrees in Machine Learning, Big Data, and Data Science domains. While I worked for TCS, I received several recognitions for my performance and today I continue to grow in my new role at UMBC as a researcher and graduate student. My drive for achieving greater goals is evident from the fact that in the little time I have been at UMBC, I received a certificate of recognition for my exceptional leadership and teamwork skills.

In the past year, I have taken courses where I learned how to use Deep Learning Algorithms via the Keras and Sci-kit Learn APIs for text classification projects. Given my experience with software development, machine learning, and my ability to adapt to requirements where research might be required, I believe I will be a strong candidate for an internship with the team. Please find attached my résumé for further details of my qualifications and feel free to email me at sofiad1@umbc.edu or (443) 554-4170.

Sincerely,
Sofia Dutta
